            <h2>History of Iloilo</h2>
            <p> Iloilo is a city in the Philippines that traces its history back to pre-colonial times as the center of Madja-as. The city originated from the town of Oton, an outpost founded by Spanish conquistador Miguel Lopez de Legazpi1. Raids by Chinese and Moro pirates forced the relocation of the outpost to Villa Rica de Arevalo. Iloilo was the second Spanish colonial center after Cebu in the Philippine Islands, and was founded in 1566. It was one of the royal Spanish cities in the Philippines in the Spanish East Indies.
